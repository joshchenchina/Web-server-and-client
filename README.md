In this project, we built up a simulation of a web browser and the corresponding network. We firstly implemented transmission delay, propagation delay and handshaking to layers. Then, we implement HTTP protocols with two certain formats for request and response. The client/ Server support GET method and are able to use if-modified header. The client contains a cache. And the server is able to produce several basic responses, such as ‘200’, ‘304’ and ‘404’. We also built up MarkUp to read and find out embedded files. What’s more, we have a ‘Dump’ command which can let severs send all files to client.
